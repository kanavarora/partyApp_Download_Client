This is the client that downloads songs using pygrooveshark.
Hard to convert it to objective-c so temporary hack is that
this python code just runs on a local server and downloads the song
in the Music Library folder.
To get it to download the song, call localhost:9000/downloadSong, with the 
appropriate stuff.
